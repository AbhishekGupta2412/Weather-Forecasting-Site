# Weather-Forecasting-Site
Creating a weather forecasting website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript involves integrating a weather API to fetch real-time weather data and displaying it in a user-friendly interface. Below is an overview of how to develop such a site:

1. Project Overview
A weather forecasting website allows users to check the weather conditions of a specific location. The site will:

Display current weather (temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.).

Show a 5-day forecast.

Allow users to search for weather by city name.

Use a weather API (like OpenWeatherMap or WeatherAPI) to fetch data.

2. Technologies Used
HTML: Structure of the website.

CSS: Styling the UI for a visually appealing design.

JavaScript: Fetching and displaying weather data dynamically.

Weather API: Fetching real-time weather information.

3. Development Steps
Step 1: Setting Up the Project
Create a project folder and add the necessary files:

index.html (for structure)

style.css (for design)

script.js (for logic)

Step 2: Designing the UI (HTML + CSS)
Create an interface with:

A search bar for users to input the city name.

A weather card to display temperature, weather conditions, and an icon.

A forecast section showing upcoming weather trends.
