# Weather-Forecasting-Site
Creating a weather forecasting website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript involves integrating a weather API to fetch real-time weather data and displaying it in a user-friendly interface. Below is an overview of how to develop such a site:

1. Project Overview
   A weather forecasting website allows users to check the weather conditions of a specific location. The site will:

    a. Display current weather (temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.).

    b. Show a 5-day forecast.

    c. Allow users to search for weather by city name.

    d. Use a weather API (like OpenWeatherMap or WeatherAPI) to fetch data.

2. Technologies Used
    a. HTML: Structure of the website.

    b. CSS: Styling the UI for a visually appealing design.

    c. JavaScript: Fetching and displaying weather data dynamically.

    d. Weather API: Fetching real-time weather information.

3. Development Steps
  Step 1: Setting Up the Project
      Create a project folder and add the necessary files:

          a. index.html (for structure)

          b. style.css (for design)

          c. script.js (for logic)

Step 2: Designing the UI (HTML + CSS)
  Create an interface with:

    a. A search bar for users to input the city name.

    b. A weather card to display temperature, weather conditions, and an icon.

    c. A forecast section showing upcoming weather trends.
